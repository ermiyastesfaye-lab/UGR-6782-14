            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>Greetings! My name is Ermiyas Tesfaye, and I'm delighted to share a little bit about myself with you. Originally hailing from the vibrant city of Addis Ababa, I have embarked on a journey of exploration, growth, and learning in the field of software engineering.

                Education has played a pivotal role in shaping my path thus far. I began my academic journey at Embut School, where I completed my primary education. Later, I had the privilege of attending Vision Academy for my high school years, where my passion for drawing flourished. During this time, I was fortunate enough to showcase my artistic talent by winning drawing contests on two separate occasions, which served as a testament to my dedication and creativity.
                
                Fuelled by a deep interest in technology and its ever-evolving landscape, I enrolled in the Software Engineering Department at Addis Ababa University. Currently in my third year of study, I am enthusiastic about honing my technical skills and expanding my knowledge in this dynamic field. The world of software engineering presents endless opportunities for innovation, problem-solving, and making a positive impact on society, and I am committed to embracing these possibilities.
                
                Beyond the realm of coding and algorithms, I find solace and joy in various activities. One of my cherished pastimes is attending church, where I connect with my spirituality and find inner peace. Additionally, I am an avid movie enthusiast; there's something captivating about losing myself in a well-crafted story that transports me to different worlds and sparks my imagination. On the physical front, I also enjoy playing football, which not only keeps me active but also fosters teamwork, discipline, and camaraderie.
                
                Life is an ongoing adventure, and I am eager to continue exploring the realms of software engineering, nurturing my artistic talents, and embracing the diverse experiences that come my way. With an open mind and a passion for growth, I look forward to making meaningful contributions to the world through my skills, creativity, and dedication.
                
                Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better. I am excited to embark on this journey together and see where our paths may intersect.</p>
